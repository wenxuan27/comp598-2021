## Counting Problem
So, this counting problem will depend on the exact definition of the Trump mention tweets.
One issue that I've noticed is that there are a lot of retweets which do contain the word "Trump". In this case, the original tweet will be counted once and then each retweet would be counted once as well. If for our definition purposes the retweets shouldn't be counted then this method would essentially have counted the retweets as original tweets.
Then, there could also be the problem of who exactly are we talking about. Specifically Donald Trump or just the name "Trump". A tweet could have been talking about "Ivanka Trump" and it would still be matched in our case.
